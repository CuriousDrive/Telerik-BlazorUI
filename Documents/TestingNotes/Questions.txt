Questions for the next meeting
    1. Is there any way to run all the tests together?
        => Yes you can add tests as steps in new steps that will allow us to run all the tests
    2. Is there any way that I can run these tests from Visual Studio Test Explorer?
        => I think that's because, system needs start browser
    3. Cascading dropdown list is not working, I even tried Build Step
    4. What's the best way to stop the test recording?
    5. Do I need to keep the test studio running in order to run the Automated Tests?
